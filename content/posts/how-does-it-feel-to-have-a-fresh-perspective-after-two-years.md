Actually, my first encounter with coding was in 2023. Artificial intelligence wasn't used back then like it is now.

Looking back, the landscape of development has changed dramatically. AI tools have become an integral part of the coding process, and it's fascinating to see how things have evolved.

## 2023: The Beginning

When I first started coding in 2023, the tools and resources were different. We had to figure things out more manually, which taught me a lot about problem-solving.

## 2025: A New Era

Now, with AI assistance, coding has become more accessible. But the fundamentals remain the same - understanding logic, problem-solving, and creativity are still at the core of programming.

## The Perspective

Having this fresh perspective after two years has been eye-opening. I can see how much I've grown, and I'm excited about what the future holds.
